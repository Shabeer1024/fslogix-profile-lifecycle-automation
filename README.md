# AVD FSLogix Lifecycle Automation

End-to-end automation for FSLogix profile management on Azure Virtual Desktop — infrastructure provisioning, autogrow, profile migration, and orphan cleanup in one repository.

---

## What's Inside

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `avd-infra/` | Terraform — full AVD + FSLogix lab (VNet, DC, session hosts, storage, autogrow runbook) |
| `terraform/` | Terraform — target storage account provisioned during migration |
| `scripts/` | PowerShell — migration, verification, and orphan cleanup |
| `.github/workflows/` | GitHub Actions — automated pipelines |

---

## Automation Workflows

### 1. FSLogix Profile Migration (`fslogix-migration.yml`)
Triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| Terraform Provision | Creates target Azure File Share storage |
| AzCopy Migration | Copies all VHDX profiles from source → target |
| Verify Migration | File count, size, and VHD presence checks |
| Update FSLogix Path | Pushes new UNC path to all AVD session hosts via Run Command |

### 2. Orphan Profile Cleanup (`orphan-profile-cleanup.yml`)
Runs automatically every **Sunday at 02:00 UTC** or manually.

| Logic | Action |
|---|---|
| Folder matches `username_S-1-5-21-*` | Extract SID, cross-reference against Entra ID |
| SID not in Entra ID + profile > 90 days old | Archive to cool-tier storage via AzCopy |
| SID not in Entra ID + profile > 180 days old | Delete with full audit log |
| Entra ID lookup fails | Skip — no false deletions |
| Summary | Teams notification + CSV audit artifact (retained 365 days) |

---

## AVD Infrastructure (`avd-infra/`)

Terraform modules:

| Module | Resources |
|---|---|
| `resourcegroup` | Azure Resource Group |
| `vnet` | Virtual Network + Subnets |
| `dc` | Domain Controller VM (AD DS) |
| `session-host` | AVD Session Host VMs |
| `avd-core` | Host Pool, App Group, Workspace |
| `fslogix-storage` | Storage Account + Azure File Share for profiles |
| `fslogix-automation` | Azure Automation Account + weekly autogrow runbook |

---

## Required GitHub Secrets

### Existing (Azure credentials)
| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Service principal app ID |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Service principal secret |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure subscription ID |
| `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` | Full JSON creds for `azure/login@v1` |

### Migration workflow
| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `SOURCE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` | Source storage account name |
| `SOURCE_STORAGE_KEY` | Source storage account key |
| `SOURCE_SHARE_NAME` | Source file share name |
| `TARGET_STORAGE_KEY` | Key for Terraform-provisioned target storage |
| `AVD_RESOURCE_GROUP` | Resource group containing the host pool |
| `AVD_HOST_POOL_NAME` | Name of the AVD host pool |
| `TF_STATE_RG` | Resource group for Terraform remote state |
| `TF_STATE_SA` | Storage account for Terraform remote state |

### Orphan cleanup workflow (additional)
| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` | Cool-tier storage account for archived profiles |
| `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_KEY` | Key for archive storage account |
| `ARCHIVE_SHARE_NAME` | Archive file share name (e.g. `fslogix-archive`) |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Teams incoming webhook URL for notifications |

### Service principal permission (orphan cleanup)
Add **Microsoft Graph → `User.Read.All`** to the service principal so the SID → Entra ID lookup works.

> For on-premises AD only (no Azure AD sync), replace the Graph API call in `scripts/orphan-profile-cleanup.ps1` with `Get-ADObject` and use a self-hosted domain-joined runner.

## The Problem This Solves

> *"My FSLogix profile is full, please resize it."*

The most repetitive support ticket in any production AVD environment. Without automation:

```
User hits "disk full"  →  Ticket raised  →  Admin investigates  →  
Coordinates user signoff  →  Manually runs Resize-VHD  →  Verifies  →  Closes
```

**4-24 hours of disruption per incident. Multiplied across hundreds of users, it's a constant fire drill.**

This project replaces that cycle with a closed-loop automation that detects and resolves capacity issues before users even notice.

---

## How It Works

```
            ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
            │              Closed-Loop Automation                  │

                                                  │
                                          executes on
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────┐
  │  Azure Files Share  │◄───────────────│  Hybrid Worker   │
  │  (FSLogix VHDXes)   │   Resize-VHD   │  (= sh01)        │
  │  100 GB hard cap    │     +5 GB      │                  │
  └─────────────────────┘                └──────────────────┘
```

**Per-VHDX decision logic:**

1. Mount VHDX read-only (skip if user is signed in — file is locked)
2. Read free space percentage
3. Dismount
4. If used > 80% AND (total allocated + 5GB) ≤ 100GB → **Resize-VHD +5GB**
5. Log result as JSON

The runbook treats each profile independently — only grows what truly needs it, leaves healthy profiles alone, enforces a hard cap on total allocated capacity to prevent budget surprises.

## Quick Start

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Deploy AVD Infrastructure
```bash
cd avd-infra
terraform init
terraform plan -out=main.tfplan
terraform apply main.tfplan
```

### Run Profile Migration
Go to **Actions → FSLogix Profile Migration → Run workflow**
- Set `dry_run: true` first to preview, then `false` to execute.

### Run Orphan Cleanup Manually
Go to **Actions → FSLogix Orphan Profile Cleanup → Run workflow**
- Always start with `dry_run: true` to review what would be cleaned.
=======
### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Contributor access
- HCP Terraform account (free tier) with workspace connected to this repo
- Azure CLI and Terraform CLI installed locally
- Globally unique storage account name (3-24 lowercase alphanumeric chars)

### 1. Configure

Update `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
resource_group_name           = "AVD-Lab"
location                      = "southeastasia"
domain_name                   = "lab.local"
admin_source_ip               = "<your-public-ip>/32"
fslogix_storage_account_name  = "stfslogix<unique-suffix>"
```

### 2. Configure HCP Terraform

In your TFC workspace, add 4 environment variables (mark secret as Sensitive):

```
ARM_CLIENT_ID        = <service-principal-app-id>
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET    = <service-principal-secret>      [Sensitive]
ARM_TENANT_ID        = <azure-tenant-id>
ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID  = <azure-subscription-id>
```

Connect the workspace to this GitHub repo, branch `main`.

### 3. Deploy

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial deploy"
git push
```

TFC auto-triggers a plan. Review in the UI → **Confirm & Apply** → ~25 minute deploy.

### 4. Post-Deploy

Follow [`LAB-SETUP.md`](./LAB-SETUP.md) to create the test user and validate FSLogix.

---

## Validating the Automation

### Verify infrastructure

```bash
# All VM extensions Succeeded
az vm extension list -g AVD-Lab --vm-name sh01 -o table

# Resize-VHD available on session host
az vm run-command invoke -g AVD-Lab -n sh01 --command-id RunPowerShellScript \
  --scripts "Import-Module Hyper-V; Get-Command Resize-VHD"

# Hybrid Worker registered
az automation hrwg show --automation-account-name aa-fslogix-avdlab \
  -g AVD-Lab --name hwg-fslogix
```

### Demo the auto-grow firing

1. **RDP to DC** (public IP) as `labadmin@lab.local`
2. **From DC, RDP to sh01** (10.0.2.x) as `testuser1@lab.local` → triggers FSLogix VHDX creation
3. **Fill the profile past 80%** from inside the session:
```powershell
   $fs = New-Object IO.FileStream("C:\Users\testuser1\Documents\bigfile.dat", [IO.FileMode]::Create)
   $fs.SetLength(8.5GB); $fs.Close()
```
4. **Sign out testuser1** (so the VHDX unlocks)
5. **Trigger the Logic App manually**:
```bash
   az rest --method POST \
     --uri "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/AVD-Lab/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/lapp-fslogix-autogrow/triggers/hourly-trigger/run?api-version=2016-06-01"
```
6. **Check Automation Account → Jobs → Output** — should show:
```json
   {
     "Status": "Resized",
     "CurrentSizeGB": 10,
     "NewSizeGB": 15,
     "UsedPercent": 85.5
   }
```

The VHDX grew from 10 GB to 15 GB. Automatically. No manual intervention.

## Why This Architecture

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Per-VHDX resize** (not share-quota expansion) | Surgical — only grows profiles that truly need it, gives per-user visibility |
| **Hybrid Worker** (not cloud sandbox runbook) | `Resize-VHD` requires the Hyper-V PowerShell module, unavailable in Azure cloud runbooks |
| **`AccessNetworkAsComputerObject=1`** | FSLogix defaults to using the logged-in user's credentials for SMB. The user has no creds for the storage account — only SYSTEM does (via cmdkey). This setting makes FSLogix use computer-account creds → finds the cmdkey entry → mounts successfully |
| **Hard cap at runbook level** | Refuses to resize if total allocated would exceed 100 GB. Predictable budget, no surprises |
| **80% threshold, 5 GB increments** | Triggers before user hits "disk full," grows gradually rather than over-provisioning |
| **Logic App scheduler** (vs Cron on a VM) | Serverless, idempotent, easy retry, audit trail in Azure |
| **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (not Azure Edition)** for DC | Azure Edition restricts the AD-DS role due to Hotpatching requirements |
| **VCS-driven HCP Terraform** | Code review gate via PR, audit trail in git, separation of plan vs apply approval |

---

## Benefits

### For end users
- No more "disk full" panic mid-work
- Profile grows quietly between sessions
- Zero perceived disruption

### For ops teams
- Zero profile-resize tickets
- ~10 hours/week saved per 100 users
- No after-hours pages for profile issues

### For finance
- Predictable storage growth in 5 GB increments
- Hard cap (100 GB) prevents runaway costs
- Only grows what truly needs it

### For security / compliance
- Every resize action logged as JSON (timestamp + before/after sizes + caller)
- MSI-based authentication (no stored credentials at runtime)
- Every code change tracked in git
- Hard cap enforced by code, not policy hope

### Quantitative ROI — 200-user environment

| Item | Without automation | With automation |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Profile-full incidents | 8/month | 0 |
| Ops time per incident | 45 min | 0 |
| User productivity lost per incident | 2 hr | 0 |
| Annual cost | **~$11,280** | **~$60** |

**Net savings: ~$11,200/year** plus intangibles (user trust, ops morale, no off-hours pages).

---

## Production Considerations

This lab is functional but simplified for clarity. For production:

| Concern | Lab approach | Production approach |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Storage authentication | Storage key via cmdkey | AD DS authentication on storage account |
| FSLogix config delivery | Direct registry write | Group Policy ADMX or Microsoft Intune |
| Network access | Public endpoint | Private Endpoint + VNet integration |
| Session host scale | Single VM | Pooled host pool with auto-scale (Azure Functions or scaling plan) |
| Profile backup | None | Azure Backup of file share + retention policy |
| Disaster recovery | None | GRS storage + paired-region failover |
| Monitoring | Runbook JSON output | Log Analytics workspace + alerts + Action Groups |
| Cap-reached notification | Log only | Teams/email alert via Action Group |
| Cap value | Hardcoded 100 GB | Per-environment variable + drift detection |

The **core pattern** (Logic App → Runbook → Hybrid Worker → action with cap enforcement) stays identical at scale.

---

## Teardown

```bash
# Stops billing immediately
az group delete --name AVD-Lab --yes --no-wait
```

Or via HCP Terraform UI: **Settings → Destruction and Deletion → Queue destroy plan → Confirm & Apply**.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| DC `install-ad` extension fails with `0x80070057` | Using Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition (doesn't support AD-DS role) | Use `2022-datacenter-g2` SKU instead |
| FSLogix login is fast (no delay), Desktop file doesn't persist | `AccessNetworkAsComputerObject` not set | Verify `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\FSLogix\Profiles\AccessNetworkAsComputerObject = 1` |
| Runbook errors with `Resize-VHD not recognized` | Hyper-V module not loaded | Ensure runbook does `Import-Module Hyper-V` at start; reboot session host once if module discovery fails |
| Runbook returns `Locked` for all profiles | Test user is currently signed in | Sign out before triggering runbook |
| VM extension stuck in `Updating` / `Deleting` | Azure ARM operation queue stuck | `az vm deallocate` then `az vm start`. Last resort: delete + recreate VM |
| `Multiple VMExtensions per handler not supported` | Two `CustomScriptExtension` resources on same Windows VM | Use `azurerm_virtual_machine_run_command` for the second one |
| `osdisk-sh01 already exists` after VM rebuild | Managed disk orphaned by `az vm delete` | `az disk delete -g AVD-Lab -n osdisk-sh01 --yes`, then retry apply |
